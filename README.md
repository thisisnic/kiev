# Kiev

Geiger counter readings from my holiday to Kiev in July/August 2019

I visited Chernobyl on Wed 31st July and flew home on Friday 2nd August.

The Geiger counter wasn't on all the time, but was on for 3 key events:

* the whole day in Chernobyl
* whilst going through the airport X-ray machine
* the entire flight home

The measurements are CPM (counts per minute) and CPS (counts per second)
